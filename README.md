# DecoyNinja: Fake Submissions Generator

## Description & Usage
A super dope tool that can batch-generate genuinely corrupted/damaged-looking PDF files that are all uniquely random in file size & the bytes in them; so no two files will ever be of the same size or byte combination, *ever*. These generated PDFs will always show as corrupted/damaged in PDF viewers â€” ideal for online submissions without any *actual* submission material.

<p>Example Execution</p>
</div>

Since the generated PDF files are all additionally equipped with genuine and *also* random PDF file headers (signatures), even if they are opened using Notepad (or any other text editor) by a slightly computer-smart person than the average lot, the content within each PDF file shall be found to be consistent with that of a typical corrupted/damaged PDF file's attributes.

*Even* if the PDF files generated by DecoyNinja are signature-tested using general Linux tools by a significantly smarter person than the regular Notepad-smart one, the content within each PDF file shall be found to be consistent with that of a typical corrupted/damaged PDF file's attributes.

This project was created in Python, for the fellow comrades and homies.

## Optimization
Multithreading was implemented in this program to generate all PDF files concurrently instead of sequentially.
